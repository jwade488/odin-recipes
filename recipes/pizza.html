    <p>Making pizza at home is a fun and rewarding experience that starts with preparing the dough. 
        The base is typically made from flour, yeast, water, olive oil, and a pinch of salt. After mixing the ingredients, the dough is kneaded until smooth and elastic, then left to rise for an hour or more. 
        This rising process helps the dough develop its texture and flavor. Once it has doubled in size, it’s rolled out into a circular shape, ready to be topped with your favorite ingredients.</p>

     <p>The sauce and toppings are where creativity comes in. A classic pizza sauce is made from crushed tomatoes, garlic, herbs, and a splash of olive oil. 
        After spreading the sauce on the dough, you can add mozzarella cheese, vegetables, meats, or any toppings you like. 
        The pizza is then baked in a hot oven—ideally on a pizza stone or baking steel—until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling. 
        Homemade pizza allows you to customize every element, making it as simple or as gourmet as you want.</p>
