    <p>Burgers are a classic and beloved food around the world, known for their versatility, rich flavor, and satisfying texture. 
        At their core, burgers consist of a seasoned meat patty—typically made from ground beef—sandwiched between two halves of a bun. 
        However, variations abound, from turkey and veggie patties to gourmet versions featuring premium toppings like blue cheese, avocado, or caramelized onions. 
        The beauty of a burger lies in its customization: with the right combination of ingredients, it can be tailored to suit virtually any taste.</p>

     <p>To prepare a great burger, start with high-quality ground beef, ideally 80/20 (80% lean, 20% fat) for the best balance of flavor and juiciness. 
        Form the beef into patties about ¾-inch thick, taking care not to overwork the meat, which can lead to a dense texture. 
        Season both sides with salt and pepper just before cooking. 
        Grill or pan-fry the patties over medium-high heat for about 3–4 minutes per side for medium doneness, adjusting based on thickness and preference. 
        During the last minute of cooking, add cheese if desired, and toast the buns until golden. 
        Assemble the burger with your favorite toppings—lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, sauces—and enjoy immediately.</p>
