    <p>Mac and cheese is a classic comfort food made with tender pasta and a rich, creamy cheese sauce. 
        The dish typically starts by boiling elbow macaroni until it’s al dente. Meanwhile, a roux is made by cooking butter and flour together, which forms the base of the sauce. 
        Milk is slowly whisked in to create a smooth béchamel, and then shredded cheese—usually cheddar—is melted in to make the sauce rich and flavorful. 
        The cooked pasta is stirred into the cheese sauce until everything is well-coated and creamy.</p>

     <p>There are many ways to customize mac and cheese to suit your taste. 
        You can mix in extras like crispy bacon, sautéed onions, or vegetables such as broccoli or peas. 
        For added texture, some people transfer the mac and cheese to a baking dish, top it with breadcrumbs and more cheese, then bake it until the top is golden and bubbly. 
        Whether served on its own or as a side dish, mac and cheese is beloved for its comforting texture and cheesy goodness.</p>
